# Replay feature boundary

Replay is a server-authoritative historical market runtime. It is not a source
toggle inside the live application. Replay and the live-page entry are present
and enabled in every normal build. The entry opens the verified v2 workbench;
there is no v1 product selector, fallback UI, or Vite entry flag. Backend data
capability remains authoritative and exposes unavailable reasons visibly.

The phase-gated v2 workbench now includes the Training Hub, source-neutral market
workspace, ViewerState and aligned replay controls, Phase 4 server-owned time
disclosure and Review/Fork, Phase 5 deterministic multi-market tracks, and the
Phase 6 versioned contract account, plus Phase 7 on-demand data segments and
safe GC, and Phase 8 explainable fast-forward plus aggregate-trade flow. New TrainingRuns use `TOUCH_OR_TAPE_V2`,
configured maker/taker policies, CROSS or ISOLATED margin, approximate Sandbox
funding, simulated-account liquidation events, and a hash-chained cash ledger.
The UI continuously labels the no-book execution boundary. A direct
`replay.html` entry opens the Hub; opaque `?run=<id>` entries open one durable
TrainingRun. A new Run contains training rules, account settings, and an
immutable account-level T0 commitment; it still contains no chart or market
track. Manual T0 is frozen at create, while range-random T0 is sampled once from
the user interval with a server seed. The user chooses the first compatible
market inside that Run, and may later search for and add
more MarketTracks without changing the Run URL or archive identity. Adapter
session ids remain internal deterministic transport details. Hub bootstrap performs only the bounded lightweight
`GET /api/v1/replay/runs` request. Historical datasets are not loaded until a
market is selected inside a concrete Run. Market selection may reject an
unlisted, coverage-incomplete, or mode-incompatible product, but it must never
move, clamp, or re-randomize the committed T0.

Phase 7 adds a checksum-bound data-segment registry over the existing immutable
BAR snapshots and raw aggTrade partition manifests without rewriting either
production store. Opening the create panel reads capabilities only; it does not
read a market catalog or prepare a dataset. Selecting a product inside the Run
reads its catalog and prepare plan, then materializes only the selected
symbol/range. The storage view shows same-source READY inventory
(with exact range reuse revalidated at create), and the fail-closed quarantine
policy. Automatic download and automatic GC workers
remain disabled by default. Explicit GC is LRU, rehydration-aware, and requires
a fresh dry-run plan hash before any replay-owned file can be reclaimed;
embedded/non-rebuildable archives are never candidates.

New training drafts default to `ALL_AVAILABLE`. Indicator warmup remains an
execution/indicator concern only; dragging the chart left requests bounded
`replay.history.v3` pages through the replay service until the revision-bound
listing boundary. Checksum-indexed source gaps are returned as explicit
`excluded_ranges`; the chart may continue before them but never fills them with
synthetic candles. Indicator state restarts at each gap, while the execution
snapshot remains confined to its original continuous segment. Existing
`DURATION` runs retain their fixed left edge. Neither mode may read a live
browser feed or expose bars to the right of the durable replay cursor. The chart
keeps a bounded in-memory window: if deep
left paging evicts newer rows, a right-edge gesture atomically restores the
latest replay-authoritative window and resets paging so the same history can
be traversed again without touching live market data.

Phase 8 adds a server-authoritative four-plan fast-forward response. The
optimization flag remains off by default; disabling it routes every advance to
the proven `FULL_EVENT_SCAN` reference path. With it enabled, only an account
without orders, positions, funding, risk, book, or multi-track path dependencies
may use `AGGREGATE_SCAN`. Every immutable source event still updates the ordered
reducer and source-event chain; only redundant intermediate state hashes and
ordinary projections are coalesced before an exact reset, with a bounded tail
published event-by-event. Progress exposes the plan, reasons, commit boundary,
queue high-water, and equivalence status.

The replay-only order-flow tab reads bounded pages no later than the revealed
source cursor. AGG_TRADE Tape is exact at aggregate-record fidelity, while
aggressor/CVD is explicitly approximate because side is inferred from
buyer-maker. Any gap or epoch change clears the projection and requires resync.
BAR shows `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE_MODE`; it never renders missing history as zero.

The configure entry always opens the v2 Hub. An explicit backend emergency stop
may reject v2 routes, but it is not a rollout mechanism. The internal `replay.v1`
actor protocol and `PAPER_LINEAR_V1` broker remain implementation details of a
v2 TrainingRun; they are not user-selectable products or archive formats. Historical-exact
funding remains fail-closed because this repository has no aligned historical
funding plus authoritative mark source. Historical L2/book-assisted execution is
also unavailable; neither boundary silently falls back to last price or zero.

## Composition roots

The two browser documents have fixed, independent roots:

```text
index.html  -> src/main.tsx        -> App       -> live runtimes only
replay.html -> src/replay-main.tsx -> ReplayApp -> replay runtimes only
```

`App` may expose an ordinary `noopener,noreferrer` link to the replay page, but
it must not own replay bars, stores, controllers, or a replay runtime.
`ReplayApp` must work without `window.opener` and must never mount a live runtime
even briefly during loading, error, recovery, or disabled states.

## Public runtime contract

Both composition roots eventually provide their own implementation of a pure
`MarketDataRuntimeContract` with exactly three top-level capabilities:

```text
view    immutable chart/read-model projection
actions intent-level operations exposed to the shell
status  source-specific health and lifecycle state
```

The shared chart/workspace consumes that contract and one `SeriesWindowStore`.
It does not select a source. Replay source identity includes the opaque session
and data epoch so live and replay caches cannot collide.

Once the chart is mounted, replay history paging is non-blocking: request
progress stays in the status bar, source history remains a `prepend`, and the
ViewerState projection forwards `prepend` plus any boundary `mid-merge` instead
of publishing a replacement dataset. Playback similarly forwards `tick` and
`append`. Only initial load, interval/identity changes, and authoritative stream
resync may replace the projected window.

## Allowed dependencies

Replay modules may depend on:

- feature-local protocol types, parser, API/stream controller, store, and pure calculations;
- the extracted market-data runtime contract and `SeriesWindowStore` delta semantics;
- chart adapter public APIs, drawing public APIs, settings, and pure layout components;
- React only in components, hooks, and composition files.

Components send intent through feature-local actions. They do not import
`src/services` directly. Runtime/controller files do not render JSX.

## Forbidden dependencies and side effects

Replay modules and `ReplayApp` must not value-import or mount:

- `useMarketDataRuntime` or any live K-line REST/WebSocket runtime;
- advanced market, order-book, full-order-book, trade-flow, liquidation, watchlist,
  watchlist full-cache, live alerts, or online indicator runtimes;
- private trading, signed requests, credentials, API keys, or real-order adapters;
- live stores, runtime singletons, subscription leases, BroadcastChannel, or
  shared localStorage containing session configuration or hidden real time.

The replay page may use type-only imports from pure shared contracts. Network
and state isolation are enforced again by architecture and browser tests in
later phases; there is no frontend entry flag or alternate product path.
