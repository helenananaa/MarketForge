## Backend Connection

The frontend uses same-origin `/api/v1` by default. During local development,
Vite proxies `/api` HTTP and WebSocket traffic to
`http://127.0.0.1:18080`. The default dev entrypoint is
`http://127.0.0.1:15173`.

Use `VITE_API_BASE` only when the backend is not reachable through the Vite
proxy, for example:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1 npm run dev
```

## Exchange Capabilities

The app loads `GET /api/v1/exchanges/` on startup and builds an exchange catalog from backend capabilities.

Frontend exchange behavior should prefer backend metadata:

- `native_intervals` drives the interval selector.
- `markets` drives available spot/futures choices where the UI exposes market filters.
- `ws_connection_model` and `protocol_features` decide whether live WS intervals are subscribed.
- `known_limitations` are surfaced in the status bar so exchange-specific gaps are visible to users.

The local `EXCHANGE_INTERVALS` table in `src/features/chart-session/exchangeCatalogRuntime.ts` is a fallback only. New exchange support should be added in the backend plugin first, then exposed through `ExchangeCapabilities`.

## Checks

Optimization execution notes:

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Optimization Execution Plan](OPTIMIZATION_EXECUTION.md)
- [Frontend Cleanup Execution Plan](FRONTEND_CLEANUP_EXECUTION.md)

```bash
npm run check:architecture
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm run check` runs the same permanent gate in order. All application and test
source under `src` is TypeScript; JavaScript remains only in Node/Vite tooling.
`npm run typecheck` validates browser production code with `tsconfig.json` and
Node-based tests/tooling with `tsconfig.node.json`; the browser project does not
receive Node ambient globals. Both projects permanently enforce
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`; type-aware ESLint
keeps the six `no-unsafe-*` rules enabled for all TypeScript application, test,
and tooling files. Test discovery accepts both `.test.ts` and
`.test.tsx` at any depth below `src`, including nested `__tests__` directories
and tests colocated with source files.

With the backend and Vite running, use the browser smoke check to verify the
rendered chart, drawing toolbar, lazy symbol search, and lazy Settings panel:

```bash
npm run smoke -- --url http://127.0.0.1:15173/
```

On this Windows Codex desktop environment, use the bundled Node executable if `npm` or `node` is not available on `PATH`.
