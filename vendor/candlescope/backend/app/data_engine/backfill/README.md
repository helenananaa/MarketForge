# Backfill

[中文](README_zh.md)

> Historical data repair pipeline for CandleScope. `BackfillEngine` detects gaps, plans REST fetches, fetches historical bars, reconciles them into storage, and publishes a `RepairReport`.

Design note: [exchange-aware rate limiting](RATE_LIMITING_DESIGN.md).

## Position In Data Engine

```text
DataManager.BackfillCoordinator
        ▼
BackfillEngine.run()
        │ detect -> plan -> fetch -> reconcile -> publish
        ▼
RepairReport.written_ranges
        ▼
DataManager precise storage readback + cache merge
```

`backfill` owns the repair pipeline. It does not own API endpoints, WebSocket delivery, DataManager cache updates, or request lifecycle coordination. Those are handled by `DataManager.BackfillCoordinator`.

## Demand-Aware Scheduling

Runtime backfill requests now flow through a demand-aware scheduler inside
`BackfillCoordinator`. `BackfillEngine` still owns detect/plan/fetch/reconcile;
the coordinator owns prioritization, chunking, deduplication, and cache/event
handoff.

Important behavior:

- Requests carry `reason`, `priority`, `requester`, and metadata.
- `/klines/history` submits `initial_history` at priority `10`.
- `/klines/latest` does not trigger backfill by default, so it cannot steal the
  first-screen history slot on a cold symbol.
- `/klines/range` uses `visible_range_gap`; `/klines/history/before` uses
  `visible_load_more`.
- Related intervals for the current symbol are scheduled as
  `related_interval_warmup` after the active interval.
- `full` subscriptions use lower-priority `full_subscription_warmup`; `price`
  subscriptions only maintain price flow plus `price_daily_open`; `none` does
  not proactively create K-line repair work.
- Large visible-range repairs are split into chunks and user-visible chunks run
  newest-first, so the right side of the chart can become renderable sooner.
- Different series can run concurrently; the same
  `(exchange, market_type, symbol, interval)` remains serialized for storage
  reconciliation.

Current priority map:

| Reason | Priority | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| `initial_history` | 10 | current chart first-screen history |
| `visible_load_more` / `visible_range_gap` | 20 | user-visible range work |
| `visible_seed_gap` | 30 | foreground custom/base warm start |
| `related_interval_warmup` | 40 | same-symbol interval warmup |
| `tail_gap` | 50 | realtime gap marker |
| `full_subscription_warmup` | 60 | full watchlist K-line maintenance |
| `price_daily_open` | 70 | price-only daily open repair |
| `latest_refresh` | 80 | low-value tail refresh |
| `query_gap` / query-derived fallback reasons | 100 | generic query repair |
| `startup_gap_scan` | 120 | startup maintenance |
| `background_gap_audit` | 150 | lowest-priority background audit |

The scheduler snapshot is exposed through DataManager diagnostics and includes
active requests, pending requests, chunk counts, local scheduler buckets, recent
outcomes, and coverage ranges. Exchange REST quota buckets are owned separately
by `HistoricalFetcher` and exposed under the backfill engine fetcher snapshot.

## Pipeline

| Phase | Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Detect | `GapDetector` | Compare requested/storage/live reference ranges and produce `GapInfo` |
| Plan | `BackfillPlanner` | Convert gaps into fetch tasks and custom interval decompositions |
| Fetch | `HistoricalFetcher` | Route closed bulk history to official archives and tails/holes/fallbacks to paginated REST |
| Reconcile | `Reconciler` | Deduplicate, aggregate custom intervals, batch-write storage, record `WrittenRange` |
| Publish | `RepairPublisher` | Log/callback final `RepairReport` |

## Quick Start

```python
from app.data_engine.backfill import BackfillConfig, BackfillEngine

engine = BackfillEngine(
    config=BackfillConfig(fetch_concurrency=2),
    storage=async_storage,      # implements StorageBackend
    transport=transport_layer,  # ingestion TransportLayer
    ingestion_config=ingestion_cfg,
)

report = await engine.run(
    symbol="BTCUSDT",
    intervals=["1m", "5m", "91m"],
    range_start_ms=1700000000000,
    range_end_ms=1700100000000,
    exchange="binance",
    market_type="spot",
)
```

Dry-run helpers:

```python
gaps = await engine.detect_only("BTCUSDT", intervals=["1m"])
plan = await engine.plan_only("BTCUSDT", intervals=["91m"])
```

In production, prefer submitting requests through DataManager/BackfillCoordinator instead of calling `BackfillEngine.run()` from API code.

## Key Models

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GapInfo` | Missing range for one `(exchange, market_type, symbol, interval)` |
| `IntervalComponent` / `IntervalDecomposition` | Custom interval decomposition into standard components |
| `BackfillTask` | One standard-interval REST fetch task |
| `BackfillPlan` | Gaps, tasks, estimated requests/bars, custom intervals |
| `FetchedBar` / `FetchResult` | Bars returned by historical REST fetches |
| `ReconcileResult` | Write counts, write errors, failed batches, written ranges |
| `WrittenRange` | Precise successfully written storage range |
| `RepairReport` | Final report consumed by BackfillCoordinator |
| `StorageBackend` | Protocol required by detector/reconciler |
| `CacheBackend` | Optional protocol retained for standalone use |

## RepairReport Contract

`RepairReport.written_ranges` is the authoritative handoff back to DataManager:

```python
report.status                 # completed / partial / failed / cancelled
report.errors                 # top-level errors
report.reconcile_result       # bars_written, write_errors, failed_batches
report.written_ranges         # exact ranges written to storage
```

BackfillCoordinator reads each `WrittenRange` back from storage and then calls `DataManager.on_bars_backfilled()`. This avoids blindly reading the original requested range, which may differ from actual writes after pagination, deduplication, custom aggregation, or partial failure.

## Custom Intervals

The planner decomposes custom intervals into standard components. Example:

```text
91m -> 1h + 30m + 1m
```

Supported decomposition strategies:

| Strategy | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `greedy_descending` | Use largest fitting standard intervals first |
| `min_requests` | Minimize expected REST calls |
| `single_base` | Use one base interval |

Alignment modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `epoch` | Align to `alignment_epoch_ms` |
| `midnight` | Align to UTC midnight |
| `market` | Align to market-open semantics when available |
| `none` | Start directly from gap start |

Custom interval writes reuse `BarAggregator.aggregate_batch()` so batch repair does not mutate live aggregator targets or active state.

## Fetching And Rate Limits

`HistoricalFetcher` uses exchange-aware concurrency and delay settings:

- Generic fetch concurrency defaults are intentionally modest.
- Binance futures defaults serialize requests more aggressively.
- OKX defaults are conservative and tests cover pagination beyond the 300-row page cap.
- HTTP 429 handling uses `Retry-After` when present and applies cooldown to
  the matching endpoint bucket.

## Official Historical Archives

Bulk closed history is transparent to chart and indicator callers:

- Complete Binance Spot and USD-M months use monthly ZIPs; recent complete
  dates may use daily ZIPs when the range would otherwise require at least
  three REST pages. Native Binance intervals use their matching archive, while
  custom intervals such as `89m` and `47m` continue to use exact `1m` input.
- The current day, partial package periods, forming candles, archive holes,
  missing objects, checksum/ZIP/schema failures, and timeouts use REST.
- Archive 404/empty results never become history-boundary evidence. Only an
  authoritative REST empty page can close the gap ledger.
- ZIPs are content-addressed under `DATA_DIR/history_archives`, survive K-line
  database deletion, and are LRU-bounded. Downloads are two-wide; archive
  SQLite imports are serialized and one object is one transaction.
- Binance checksum sidecars are revalidated every 24 hours. A revision
  invalidates overlapping derived custom bars before regeneration.
- OKX is disabled by default. When explicitly enabled, startup probes its
  unstable website download contract and disables the complete capability on
  incompatible URLs, schema, or `confirm` semantics.

Fetcher diagnostics expose the selected source, cache/object counts, bytes,
download/parse timing, REST tail/fallback counts, and singleflight waiters.

## Deduplication

`DeduplicationStrategy` values:

- `skip`: keep existing rows.
- `overwrite`: always write fetched repair rows.
- `backfill_wins`: fetched repair rows replace duplicates.
- `newer_wins`: legacy alias for `backfill_wins`.

Write failures are surfaced through `ReconcileResult.write_errors` and `failed_batches`. A run with partial writes returns `PARTIAL`, not `COMPLETED`.
