"""Authoritative K-line source quality and finality policy.

The SQLite schema intentionally keeps provenance in the existing ``source``
column.  This module is therefore the single policy surface used by Python
merges and by the generated SQLite ``CASE`` expression.  Keeping both paths
derived from the same mapping prevents cache/storage precedence drift.
