# Script Runtime Plugin Host

[简体中文](README_zh.md)

`app.plugin_runtime` is CandleScope's generic script-runtime sidecar host. It
depends only on the public `candlescope-plugin-sdk` protocol models. It imports
neither Pyne nor Pine Compatibility. The generic Indicator routing layer uses
this Host without giving plugins access to CandleScope internals.

Phases 2 through 4 own:

- a strict, versioned runtime activation registry;
- direct absolute executable plus argv launch, never a shell;
- `handshake` and `describe` verification of runtime ID, package, version, and
  feature negotiation;
- serialized JSON-RPC with message, stderr, startup, request, and shutdown
  bounds;
- session disposal after timeout, crash, stdout contamination, or protocol
  failure;
- lazy restart within a bounded attempt window, followed by an open circuit;
- FastAPI lifecycle ownership and a summary-only `/health` projection.
- strict deterministic `.cspkg` and caller-pinned outer SHA-256 verification;
- one isolated, offline wheel-only environment per bundle;
- atomic activation and a per-runtime rollback chain after descriptor and
  deterministic result probes pass.

HTTP compute, range/batch, and Indicator WebSocket script traffic now share the
generic `legacy/shadow/sidecar` router. Since Phase 8, a missing route file
selects both `pyne=sidecar,candlescope.pyne` and
`pine=sidecar,candlescope.pine-compat`; startup fails closed until both managed
runtimes are installed and active. See
[Indicator Runtime Routing](../indicator/RUNTIME_ROUTING.md).

Phase 7 adds `GET /api/v1/indicators/runtimes`, a frontend-safe projection of
the already validated routes and public runtime descriptors. It exposes no
registry path, launch command, PID, stderr, or host failure detail. Community
language IDs therefore require no CandleScope frontend adapter.

Phase 8 extends the product bootstrap to multiple pinned first-party runtimes.
It verifies every pending bundle before the first registry mutation, then
installs in deterministic runtime-ID order. Community activation and install
contracts remain unchanged.

## Activation registry v1

The default registry is stored under user data:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CandleScope/plugins/runtime-registry.json`;
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/candlescope/plugins/runtime-registry.json`, falling
  back to `~/.local/share/candlescope/plugins/runtime-registry.json`.

A missing default path means zero plugins. Once
`CANDLESCOPE_RUNTIME_REGISTRY` is explicitly set, a missing or malformed file
fails closed.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "hello-runtime",
      "package": "candlescope-plugin-sdk",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "enabled": true,
      "autoStart": true,
      "required": false,
      "launch": {
        "executable": "C:/absolute/plugin-venv/Scripts/python.exe",
        "args": [
          "-I",
          "-u",
          "-m",
          "candlescope_plugin_sdk.examples.hello_runtime"
        ],
        "workingDirectory": "C:/absolute/plugin-venv"
      },
      "timeouts": {
        "startupSeconds": 5,
        "requestSeconds": 30,
        "shutdownSeconds": 2
      },
      "limits": {
        "maxMessageBytes": 16777216,
        "maxStderrBytes": 65536
      },
      "restart": {
        "maxAttempts": 3,
        "windowSeconds": 60
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This registry is resolved activation state, not a download manifest. The Phase
3 `.cspkg` installer verifies a caller-pinned hash, creates an isolated
environment, and writes this file atomically. The host never downloads or
guesses an entry point. Hand-written registries remain useful for local
development, but unmanaged entries cannot use the installer's exact
`check`/`rollback` operations.

CandleScope's product layer is intentionally separate: before constructing
this generic Host, `app.first_party_plugin_bootstrap` may materialize the exact
official runtimes pinned in `app/official-plugin-releases.json` and invoke the
same local installer. It never selects community plugins, and it refuses to
replace an unmanaged activation with the same ID. Set
`CANDLESCOPE_OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BOOTSTRAP=0` to disable this first-party policy or
`CANDLESCOPE_OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BUNDLE=<path>` for a digest-identical offline
first run. The path is a file for one routed official runtime and a directory
containing the pinned filenames for multiple runtimes. The Host and installer
themselves remain network-free.

Installer-created entries also carry `managed.installationId`,
`managed.activationId`, and `managed.bundleSha256`, binding activation state to
an immutable install and exact history record. Manual entries omit them.

`required=true` also requires `autoStart`. A required startup failure aborts
application startup. An optional failure remains diagnosable and marks the
plugin summary as `degraded`.

## Run, install, and roll back

The normal backend dependency install also installs the repository SDK:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inspect, install, check, and roll back one runtime:

```powershell
python scripts/candlescope_plugin.py inspect C:\release\runtime.cspkg
python scripts/candlescope_plugin.py install C:\release\runtime.cspkg `
  --sha256 sha256:<trusted release digest>
python scripts/candlescope_plugin.py check <runtime-id>
python scripts/candlescope_plugin.py rollback <runtime-id>
```

See [`INSTALLER.md`](INSTALLER.md) for the manifest, release workflow, and
atomic transaction model. Restart the app after a successful install or
rollback; Phase 3 does not hot reload the registry.

Select a development registry:

```powershell
$env:CANDLESCOPE_RUNTIME_REGISTRY = "C:\absolute\runtime-registry.json"
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

Emergency-disable the entire host without reading the registry or launching a
sidecar:

```powershell
$env:CANDLESCOPE_PLUGIN_HOST_ENABLED = "0"
```

`GET /health` returns only `status/configured/enabled/ready/failed`; it never
exposes commands, the registry path, or stderr. Internal
`RuntimeHostService.diagnostics()` provides full diagnostics and excludes
stderr unless explicitly requested.

## Security boundary

- Plugins inherit a small allowlist of OS, temporary-directory, locale,
  certificate, and PATH variables. Arbitrary application API keys and custom
  environment variables do not cross the boundary.
- stdout is JSON-RPC only; logs are kept in a bounded stderr tail.
- POSIX termination targets a dedicated process group. Windows currently
  guarantees termination of the primary sidecar, not a malicious descendant
  tree.
- v1 provides no secrets, network permission declaration, trading action, or
  host filesystem capability.
- A sidecar and isolated environment are dependency and fault boundaries, not
  a hostile-code sandbox. Activate trusted packages only.
- Phase 3 verifies caller-pinned SHA-256 and wheel contents, but a digest does
  not authenticate a publisher. v1 has no signatures, transparency log, or OS
  permission sandbox.

## Focused gate

```powershell
cd backend
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path '..\packages\candlescope-plugin-sdk\src').Path
python -m pytest -q `
  tests/test_plugin_runtime_*.py `
  tests/test_plugin_bundle.py `
  tests/test_plugin_installer.py
```

The suite covers bundle path and metadata negatives, isolated environments,
idempotent install, probe failure, upgrade, and per-runtime rollback. Host
coverage still includes a real Hello session plus crash, timeout, duplicate
keys, wrong IDs, invalid JSON, message/stderr limits, environment isolation,
restart circuits, and application lifecycle cases.
